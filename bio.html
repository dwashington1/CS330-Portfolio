                <h1>About me</h1>
                <h4>My name is Dave Washington. I am a third year undergraduate at Northwestern University majoring in Computer Science. I have interned
                    in various fields of computer science such as big data and cloud computing at companies such as Direct Supply and Google and have
                    experiece working from fairly large starting code bases. I have worked with many different programming language and genderally know
                    when one language may be more suited for a task than another. I have experience in a lot of low level programming such as work in systems
                    and networking. This summer, I intend to return to Google for my second internship with them. My intended graduation date is June 2021.</h4>
